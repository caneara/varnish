# Introduction

This library contains a complete set of UI components. They range from something as simple as a button, to as complex as a Markdown-based text editor.

Originally, these components were part of the [Lumeno](https://lumeno.dev) codebase, however they have since been extracted, extended and made available for [open-source](https://github.com/caneara/varnish/blob/main/LICENSE.md) use.

## Breaking changes

Varnish is in the early stages of development and is pre version 1.0. Therefore, major breaking changes are likely ahead of its official release.

Since these changes are not usually documented, using Varnish in production is not recommended at this time. Instead, it should be used for prototyping and experimentation. Once version 1 has been released, full semantic versioning will be used to ensure that your projects have protection against breaking changes.
