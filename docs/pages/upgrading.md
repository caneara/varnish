# Upgrading

The version 2+ of Varnish uses a non-native font, which will cause breaking changes to anyone below this version. You should therefore follow the recommendations outlined below depending on which version of Varnish you are currently using.

## Version 1

If you are using Version 1, then it is recommended that you do not upgrade.

## Version 2

If you are starting a fresh project and are happy to use the commercial, variable font 'Proxima Vara', then you can use Version 2.

Alternatively, you can use Version 2 with a different (or native) font, however you may need to make CSS changes.

## Version 3

This version does away with the Writer component which was buggy and had UI issues. If you are using the Writer component, then you should stick with version 2.
