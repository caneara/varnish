# Upgrading

Major builds can and do introduce breaking changes. Follow the information below to assist in upgrading to the desired version.

## Version 1

If you are using Version 1, then it is recommended that you do not upgrade.

## Version 2

If you are starting a fresh project and are happy to use the commercial, variable font 'Proxima Vara', then you can use Version 2.

Alternatively, you can use Version 2 with a different (or native) font, however you may need to make CSS changes.

## Version 3

This version does away with the Writer component which was buggy and had UI issues. If you are using the Writer component, then you should stick with version 2.

## Version 4

This version replaces the Notice component with the Alert component. You should review the Alert page to see the differences.

The Tabs component has been simplified. It is now intended primarily for immediate actions or redirects. It no longer preserves the chosen tab between pages.

We have also done away with the playgrounds which were not maintained when new functionality was added.
