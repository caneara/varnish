# Undocumented Components

Several components are included in the library that are not documented within this guide. These components make use of back-end (Laravel) and front-end (InertiaJS) frameworks which are necessary for their functionality.

These components are regularly used by Caneara applications, which is why they have been extracted and included within Varnish. That said, they are intended for internal use and are not recommended for use in userland.

In short, if you only reference components mentioned in this guide, you'll be fine.
